WARNING:
THIS IS OLD CODE THAT I WROTE AT THE AGE OF 16
This code is not clean code. The implementation of the logic is written in the .hpp files. This is not common.

I hosted this years ago on https://bitbucket.org/ckrex/space_invaders/src/master/

Space invaders with ncurses

![alt text](https://github.com/joshua-classen/SpaceInvadesTerminal/blob/master/SpaceInvadesTerminal.png?raw=true)

COMPILE under LINUX
you need a g++ that supports c++11
You need libncurses5-dev

If you have that installed just type "make"
After that you can execute the app via ./space_invaders

COMPILE under OSX
I just typed "make" and it works

I write the Code as a beginner 3 years ago and there are many ugly things in it that i would not write again today. But it works :D
